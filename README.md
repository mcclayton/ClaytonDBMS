A database management system I made for CS448.

HOW TO RUN:
    INTERACTIVE MODE:   Run command: 'java -jar ./minidbms.jar username'
    BATCH MODE:         Run command: 'java -jar ./minidbms.jar username < inputBatchFile.sql'

1. It should be noted that I used the GeneralSQLParser library as the basis of my SQL parsing (which I was told was ok to do).
2. Table/attribute names are case sensitive.
